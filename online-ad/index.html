    <p class="justify-text">Kyuki-do originated in south Korea, being founded by master OK Hyung Kim in 1967 and derives the majority of its techniques from Judo, Jiu-Jitsu, Teakwondo, 
        and Hapkido. Kykuki-do also incoorperates Kobudo, the practice of traditional weapons too. In addition to the forementioned martial arts styles Kyuki-do 
        includes various techniques from other styles such as Muay Thai, Boxing, and Wushu(Chinese Kung Fu).
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="center-text" style="font-size: 25px">Why you should train in Kyuki-do!</h2>

        - "To have some violent fun in safe and supporting environment"<br>
        - "To have the knowledge and ability to protect yourself"
    </blockquote>

    <h3 class="center-text" style="font-size: 25px;">What makes up Kyuki-do?</h2>
    <p class="justify-text" > As mentioned above Kyuki-do is mix of several different styles of martial arts. Below is an in-depth breakdown of what Kyuki-do really is fundamentally.</p>   
    
    <h4 class="left-text" style="font-size: 10">Teakwondo</h3>
    <p class="justify-text">Teakwondo is where Kyuki-do derives the majority of its strikes. Examples of teakwondo strikes within Kyuki-do
        are mainly evident within majority of Kyuki-do's kicks. These include round kicks, roundhouse kicks, sidekicks, tornado kicks, etc.<br>
        <br>
        In addition to striking Kyuki-do also adopted Teakwondo's sparring ruleset. Sparring in Kyuki-do is done under a point system and takes place within a
        16ft. by 16ft ring surrounded by four judges. Combatents spar within the ring until one lands a strike on the other, the match is then
        stopped breifly for each corner judge to determine whether or not a point was scored. Punches to face and knockouts are generally prohibited
        within Kyuki-do sparring. Protective gear is manditiory.
    </p>
        <h4 class="left-text" style="font-size: 10">Traditional Jiu-Jitsu</h3>
        <p class="justify-text"> Kyuki-do incoorperates Traditional Jiu-Jitsu into its repertoire of martial arts, considered to be highly effective Jiu-Jitsu teaches applicants pins, 
            armbars, leglocks, and chokeholds necessary for one to be able to fight while on the ground because of this Jiu-jitsu acts as the primary 
            fighting style for when a fight goes to the ground for any practitioner of Kyuki-do.<br>
            <br>
            Unlike Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Traditional Jiu-Jitsu requires all particpants to wear a gi or uniform.
        </p>
        <h4 class="left-text" style="font-size: 10">Judo</h3>
            <p class="justify-text"> Kyuki-do also has a large focus on Judo as well. Judo is a martial art primarily focused on takedowns, throws and grappling while standing.
                Kyuki-do takes the majority of its throws from Judo. These include, but are not
                limited to leg-sweeps, hip-throws, shoulder-throws, and advanced "sacrifice" takedowns such as the scissor sweep takedown. <br>
                <br>
                Judo acts Kyuki-do's answer for grappling situations whilst standing giving it's practitioners the know-how and understanding to safely
                and effectively throw and takedown opponents.
        </p>
        <h4 class="left-text" style="font-size: 10">Hapkido</h3>
            <p class="justify-text"> The last major style in Kyuk-do is Hapkido, Hapkido is a martial arts style that focuses solely on joint locks and takedowns
                regarding joint locks, Hapkido acts to allow the martial artist to apply submissions upon smaller joints mainly focusing on
                 techniques capable of breaking opponents wrists and fingers. <br>
                <br>
                Hapkido acts to further increase Kyuki-do's effectivness at grappling and to give Kyuki-do practitioners more options to subdue opponents.
